X---------------------------- Completed/CLEANUP STAGE: ------------------------------X

tweet volume over time -> tweet volume regarding both platforms follows a similar trend 
----CLEANUP STAGE 

tweets by country -> only conclusion to draw is that theyre almost evenly popular acorss 
twitter users by country due to the bias we have introduced with filtering ----CLEANUP STAGE 

posting frequency of playstation and xbox marketing accounts -> xbox begins to 
post much more heavily on the run up to release ----CLEANUP STAGE 

sentiment scores for both playstation and xbox -> t-tested. xbox has a more positive overall sentiment than playstation
but both are positive. ----CLEANUP STAGE 

games to be released by genre in the next 2 years -> identify gaps in the market on each platform 
----CLEANUP STAGE 

sentiment over time for both playstation and xbox. - What are the trends in sentiment for each platform?
LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL  ----CLEANUP STAGE

t-tests of sentiment scores compared with neutral data. - are our results statistically significant when compared with a
neutral twitter opinion?  ----CLEANUP STAGE 

CHRIS-- sentiment over time compared to posting frequency of xbox and playstation marketing accounts. - Which company is having a 
greater impact with their marketing?  LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL ----CLEANUP STAGE
-> no substantial correlation between marketing posts by official accounts and change in sentiment on twitter. can suggest that
marketing is not having a substantial effect on consumer opinion 


X----------------------------TO DO: ------------------------------X

sentiment of tweets based on keywords or identified purchase factors such as price, hardware specs, games selection 
 
GRIFFIN - volume of tweets based on game name. - Which games are being talked about the most and which genre are they in?
- Maybe just use games that have already been released and are exclusive to a platform by finding a list online.
the number of games should be low. Use aliases of the games in order to get more tweet results after filtering. 

ELIS-- sentiment of tweets based on mention of game organised into genre. - Which games are getting the most positive 
reaction and which system are they on?

GRIFFIN-- word cloud for each system to identify talking points - what are the main topics that will influence platform purchase?

introduction -
who are we pretending to be? what are our goals of the analysis? SEE BELOW

exposition x2 -
explanation of the console industry and the history of previous generations. how does the market typically
develop, who won the last generations etc etc?

11 slides dedicated to the graphs with 
5 slides dedicated to other things (possibly explanation of the graphs we show or other stuff=

conclusion -
what are the concrete conclusions that we can draw from our data? 
what are the limitations of our analysis 

x ---------------------- SCENARIO: ---------------------- x 

We are a popular game development studio which is deciding on our next game. We need to decide on a genre of game and
a platform that the game is going to be released on. We have been offered exclusive deals by both microsoft and playstation,
but we also have the opportunity to develop multi-platform if we feel this is the bexst option.  

Which platform and genre of game are the best choice to begin work on? which platform in the new generation is going
to dominate and allow us to reach more customers? which platform gives us the opportunity to develop a memorable and
beloved game?
